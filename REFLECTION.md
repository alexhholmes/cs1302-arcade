1. **DONE:** Brainstormed how we would design the scene graphs and the class
    structure for the storage of game data and the game controller. Created 
    game selection scene. Created some skeleton code for the Tetris game view
    and data storage.

2. **TODO:** Create the tetris view, data storage, and controller to complete
    the game.

3. **PROB:** Brainstorming took a while to plan out the project. Ran into a lot
    of issues in terms of how we should structure the creation of the new scenes
    and the design pattern for each game themselves.
