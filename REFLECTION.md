1. **DONE:** Brainstormed how we would design the scene graphs and the class
    structure for the storage of game data and the game controller. Created 
    game selection scene. Created some skeleton code for the Tetris game view
    and data storage.

2. **TODO:** Create the tetris view, data storage, and controller to complete
    the game.

3. **PROB:** Brainstorming took a while to plan out the project. Ran into a lot
    of issues in terms of how we should structure the creation of the new scenes
    and the design pattern for each game themselves.

1. **DONE:** Added block images for tetris game. Created enumeration structure for
   the tetris blocks. Created a data structure for 2048. Added UI elements and
   game view to 2048. Brainstormed for game mechanics in tetris.

2. **TODO:** Finish the 2048 game on a mechanical level. Create tetris game view
   and implement basic game mechanics such as blocks falling and rotating.  

3. **PROB:** The data structure for both games proved to be a difficult task as
   there are a plethora of ways to go about it. Implementing mechanics such as how
   to get the tetris blocks to rotate and make the blocks fall smoothly has been no
   easy task
